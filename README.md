Note, this is sort of just for my personal reference as I'm trying to learn Python/Flask/MySQL for a new project on which I'm working that requires I use Python instead of my usual goto favorite backend language, PHP.

Also, I received an error when actually attempting to insert data into my MySQL Database using the code from this tutorial. So if anyone happens to stumble upon this code, know that it's slightly broken. I think that the bug is in the 'stored procedure' SQL code, but I'm not sure exactly. It wasn't worth my time trying to fix someone elses tutorial, I just plan on watching some other Flask-MySQL tutorials on YouTube or whatnot :)
